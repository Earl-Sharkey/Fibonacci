# Fibonacci
AppleScript - generates n length fibonacci sequence or identifies nth term in fibonacci sequence

Some errors do exist :)

Length of sequence is limited by machine computing capabilities. This program is limited to 1476 terms but can be modified. 
The 1477th term was too large for my machine.
